# SXHKD module with BPSWM-specific commands

# Part of my dotfiles: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

# Description
# ===========
#
# Partial configuration file for the Simple X Hotkey Daemon.  Meant to
# work with `bspwm`.  This is part of my dotfiles, which are managed
# with GNU Stow.  See https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
#
# LARGE PORTIONS OF THIS FILE INVOKE MY SHELL SCRIPTS.  Do not blindly
# copy-paste from here!

# Close {or kill} currently focused node
super + {_,shift + }q
	bspc node -{c,k}

# Focus/swap nodes/desktops
# -------------------------

# Focus the node in the given direction.
super + {h,j,k,l}
	bspc node -f {west,south,north,east}

# Swap focused window with the one in the given direction.  If there is
# no window in that direction, a receptacle will be created.  Inputting
# any direction again will move the focused window to the position of
# the receptacle.  This will effectively remove it from the current
# layout, creating a more fluid workflow that does not constrain you to
# the tree of the tiling scheme.
#
# IF you only ever want to move a window into an existing one and avoid
# the added features of the scripted behaviour, use the following
# command instead:
#
# 	bspc node -s {west,south,north,east}
#
# TIP after breaking free from the layout, you can use --balance to
# spread out the nodes (see the key chord further down).  You may also
# --rotate the tree.
#
# bspwm_smart_move is part of my dotfiles (link in the description).

	bspwm_smart_move {west,south,north,east}

# Dynamic desktop behaviour:  this invokes a script of mine that
# implements dynamic desktops (see dotfiles).  If the given desktop
# number is missing, it is created on the spot.  Empty desktops are then
# removed automatically.
#
#
# super + <number> = focus the given desktop
# super + shift + <number> = send focused window to given desktop
# super + ctrl + shift + <number> = as above, but send to next monitor
# super + ctrl + <number> = switches the active (visible) desktop of the
# unfocused monitor, without focusing it (focus stays on the current
# desktop/monitor).  It also inserts a receptacle, meaning that the next
# created window will go there without calling focus to itself (see my
# bspwm_external_rules).
#
#
# Commands for receptacles are defined in the "advanced operations"
# section.
#
# NOTE the leading `;` runs this command asynchronously.
#
# NOTE2 the script also offers commands for sending to a desktop on the
# current or the next monitor and following it right away.  The
# shorthand for those is `--nsf' and `--nmf' respectively.  A
# commented-out version is provided below the enabled key bindings,
# which replaces the "send" commands noted above with their
# "send+follow" equivalents.
# super + {_,shift + ,ctrl + shift +,ctrl +}{0-9}
#	;bspwm_dynamic_desktops {--df,--ns,--nm,--da} {0-9}

## Use this for "send+follow" instead of just "send"
# super + {_,shift + ,ctrl + shift +,ctrl +}{0-9}
#	;bspwm_dynamic_desktops {--df,--nsf,--nmf,--da} {0-9}

# With `alt` focus {next,previous} window in the current desktop.  With
# `super` focus {next,previous} desktop in the current monitor.
# Cyclical behaviour.  Move in the opposite direction while also holding
# down `shift`.
{super,alt} + {_,shift +} Tab
	bspc {desktop,node} -f {next,prev}.local

# Switch to the other monitor.
super + o
	bspc monitor -f next

# Switch to last active {desktop,node}.  With super move to the last
# active desktop.  With alt move to the last active node. "grave" is
# positioned above Tab in QWERTY layouts.

	bspc {desktop,node} -f last

# Expand or contract node in the given direction.
#
# For floating windows one can use Alt + Right Mouse click to
# drag/resize in the given direction (this works in other DEs as well,
# such as MATE and Xfce).  I have not set the script to resize floating
# windows because: (i) I do not use them and if I do I do not want to
# change their dimensions, and (ii) to keep the script concise.

# Click to drag).  I seldom use floating windows.

# Preselect the direction or insert again to cancel the preselection.
# This enters the manual tiling mode that splits the currently focused
# window.

# Preselect the ratio.  The default value is 0.5, defined in `bspwmrc`.

# Node layout state and flags
# ---------------------------

# Toggle monocle layout (maximise focused node).  If you use `-l
# monocle` you lose the toggle functionality.
super + l
	bspc desktop -l next

# Toggle floating, tiled, fullscreen view.  Tiled is what is used by
# default. Floating windows have their own dimensions and can be stacked
# on top of each other.
#
# NOTE the presence of the tilde ~.  If current state matches the given
# state, then the argument is interpreted as the last state.
super + {shift + space,space,f}
 	bspc node -t ~{tiled,floating,fullscreen}

# Set the node flags.  Locked is a node that cannot be closed with `bspc
# node --close`.  Marked is a specific selector that allows operating on
# the given item (such as sending the marked item to the newest
# preselection).  Sticky stays in the focused desktop.  Private tries to
# keep its dimensions and tiling position.

# bspwm_external_rules command (which is called from within bspwmrc).

# Insert receptacle following the tiling scheme or preselection.

# Continuous input mode
# =====================
# EXPLAIN: The following key chords have a colon sign `:' before their
# last part.  By pressing the keys to the left of the colon, you can
# then pass the commands by only using the keys to the right of the
# colon.  This eliminates the need for repeated chord presses that
# involve the modifier keys.  Exit the mode with "Escape".
#
# NOTE: All of the following are mirrors of their afore-mentioned
# couterparts.

# Resize node in the given direction.
super + c : {h,j,k,l}
	bspwm_resize {west,south,north,east} 50

# Mode for dynamic gaps.
